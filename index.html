		<h3>DOGECOIN<h3>
		<p>An open-source peer-to-peer digital currency, favoured by Shiba Inus worldwide. At its heart, Dogecoin is the accidental crypto movement that makes people smile! It is also an opensource peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that utilises blockchain technology, a highly secure decentralised system of storing information as a public ledger that is maintained by a network of computers called nodes. More than this, though, is the ethos of Dogecoin, summarised in the Dogecoin Manifesto , and its amazing, vibrant community made up of friendly folks just like you!</p>

		<h3>SHIBA INU<h3>
		<p><strong>Shiba Inu</strong> is an Ethereum-based altcoin (a cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) that features the Shiba Inu—a Japanese breed of hunting dog—as its mascot. Shiba Inu is widely considered to be an alternative to Dogecoin; in fact, proponents of Shiba Inu have touted it in the past as "the Dogecoin killer."
		Shiba Inu is a meme coin, which is a cryptocurrency associated with some theme—like the Shiba Inu—but is often launched as a parody or inside joke rather than as a digital product that actually has utility. Shiba Inu was created in August 2020 by an anonymous individual or group called Ryoshi, but is now lead by a person using the name Shytoshi Kusama.</p>

		<h3>USD COIN<h3>
		<p><strong>USD Coin (USDC)</strong> is a digital currency that is fully backed by U.S. dollar assets. USDC is a tokenized U.S. dollar, with the value of one USDC coin pegged as close to the value of one U.S. dollar as it can get. The value of USDC is designed to remain stable, making USDC a stablecoin.
		Stablecoins are commonly backed by reserve assets like dollars or euros to achieve price stability. The price stability of USDC contrasts sharply with the notorious price fluctuations of other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
